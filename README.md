Querying databases, Organizing and Plotting Data: Query Pymatgen and Mendeleev for properties like Young's modulus and melting temperature Organize data into Pandas dataframes and python dictionaries and plot using Plotly Linear Regression to predict material properties: Performed linear regression using the scikit learn package and predict Young's modulus Visualize trends in data and 'goodness of fit' of linear model Neural Network Regression to predict material properties: Used neural networks to perform non-linear, higher order regression Visualize trends and compare non-linear model to linear regression Neural Network Classification to predict crystal structures: Used neural networks to classify elements according to their crystal structures
