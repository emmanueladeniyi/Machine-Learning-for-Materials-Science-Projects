Querying databases, Organizing and Plotting Data: Query Pymatgen for properties like Young's modulus, melting temperature, and other properties. Organize data into Pandas data frames and python dictionaries and plot using Plotly Linear Regression to predict material properties: Performed linear regression using the scikit learn to package and predict Young's modulus Visualize trends in data and 'goodness of fit' of linear model Neural Network Regression to predict material properties: Used neural networks to perform non-linear, higher-order regression Visualize trends and compare the non-linear model to linear regression Neural Network Classification to predict crystal structures: Used neural networks to classify elements according to their crystal structures
